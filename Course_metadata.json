The in-act modernization of the CAP is successfully including the opportunities offered by the Copernicus programme, such as EO*GI solutions and each EU farmer (also through farmer associations, agencies, etc) is stimulated to improve his/her “e-governance”.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAfter specific analyses/controls at national and regional level, nowadays well supported by the Copernicus Programme, EU officers authorize the final funds transferring to each EU Member States and then to each single beneficiary.",

Three components make up Copernicus: Space, Services and In Situ. The one of Services Component is for land areas: CLMS. Within these services, the data collected are processed to give reliable and up-to-date information about the land areas. CLMS provides geographical information on land cover to a broad range of users in the field of environmental terrestrial applications. The land theme is divided into four main components: Global, Pan-European, Local and Imagery and reference data. This includes information on land cover characteristics and changes, land use, vegetation state, water cycle and Earth surface energy variables. Copernicus products and services are continually evolving. The course provides an overview of search engines through which data on land cover can be obtained.",

First one hit town of Zagreb on March 22nd with a magnitude of 5.5 on Richter scale, and second one on December 29th hit the area of Banija (epicentre near town of Petrinja) with the magnitude of 6.2 on Richter scale. Both earthquakes resulted in severe damages and human losses. Already after Zagreb earthquake a great need for spatial interpretation of the event and its aftermath has been recognized. Therefore, after the earthquake in Petrinja, a quick reaction of geodetic experts followed, using modern   satellite and geoinformation (GI) technologies to provide information on the aftermath of the earthquake.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe webinar focuses on contribution of satellite technologies (EO and GNSS) after catastrophes, result of which might be some form of ground displacement, with the emphasis on fast response. Relevancy of fast response, short theoretical background on technologies and practical application examples as well as how scientific interpretation can be given are included in the webinar.

Radiometric corrections are required due to variations in scene lighting and viewing geometry, atmospheric conditions and noise, and sensor response. Each will vary depending on the particular sensor and platform used for data collection and the conditions during data collection. It may also be desirable to convert and/or calibrate the data into known (absolute) units of radiation or reflection to facilitate data comparison. Geometric corrections are intended to compensate for geometric distortions so that the geometric representation of the imagery will be as close as possible to the real world. Many of these variations are systematic, or predictable in nature and can be accounted for by accurate modeling of the sensor and platform motion and the geometric relationship of the platform with the Earth. Other unsystematic, or random, errors cannot be modeled and corrected in this way. Therefore, geometric registration of the imagery to a known ground coordinate system must be performed.",

The particular location of the site, along the steep internal slopes of the volcano, required a strong control over the area development with massive terracing works. The instability phenomena seem to be related to the very high acclivity values of top sector of the slope favouring the activation of modest collapse phenomena as well as by ordinary management and maintenance of the area (e.g. invasive vegetation, absence of drainage systems). Preliminary InSAR analysis were performed exploiting ERS and COSMO Sky-Med datasets; the first dataset show ground lowering phenomena, highlighting that subsidence affected areas close Phlegrean Fields during that period (1993 – 2003). The deformation rates (5-10 mm/yr) recorded in the investigated time interval are consistent with the general down lift cycle, while time series show some small uplift events. InSAR data processing will take into consideration ERS and COSMO Sky-Med datasets and the most recent SENTINEL-1 data, allowing us to assess the instability phenomena evolution of the area in a recent  time interval.",

Diverse resources are used to generate solar energy forecasts, ranging from measured weather and operation system data to satellite observations of clouds and weather forecasting models.

Two procedures used to select the best variables for splitting the tree nodes will be discussed by making use of a practical example. These procedures include Gini impurity and information gain. The overfitting and underfitting concepts will be explained in the second part of the lecture when we will introduce two solutions to build the optimal DT, i.e. a DT that does not overfit: (1) stop growing the DT early before overfitting and (2)pruning or reducing the size of the tree.
