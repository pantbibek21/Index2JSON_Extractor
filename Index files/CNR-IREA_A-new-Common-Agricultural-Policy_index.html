		<meta property="dc:title" content="A new Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) based on Copernicus programme and EO4GEO tools" />

		<meta property="dc:publisher" content="CRN-IRNEA" />
		<meta property="dc:subject" content="The webinar has the overall objective to promote the new opportunities offered by the Copernicus Programme in dealing with the Common Agriculture Policy. The EU Commission has indeed encouraged Member States for the use of Earth Observation (EO) technologies, especially for monitoring in a continuous way the correct payment of all declared areas for aid. This initiative arises in the context of the EO4GEO project Sector Skills Alliance and its tools concerning EO*GI. Participants will be also addressed on how to use EO*GI in the agricultural domain, exploiting the opportunity to access to free training data." />
		<meta property="dc:abstract" content="European agriculture is facing a number of challenges such as increasing urbanization, loss of historical rural and agricultural landscapes, vulnerability by climate change effects, new competition by imported goods etc. These challenges lead to lower incomes and loss of sector attractivity, especially for younger generations.
							The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and the forthcoming new legislation is aimed at the agro- environmental sustainability.
							The objectives of the CAP are to ensure a stable and affordable food supply promoting the local
							and EU own food production, reducing the import of primary goods, enable farmers to obtain a stable living, promote sustainable use of resources, maintain rural landscapes and the agro- environment safeguard of the countryside, supporting the rural economy.
							The CAP started at the end of 1970 for the European organization of the agro-market, but since 1992 became geographical-based through the support of satellite data.
							It currently consists of around 40 Billion euros of annual subsidies distributed to 8 million of European farmers and has been promoting the Remote Sensing Agricultural sector in Europe. The in-act modernization of the CAP is successfully including the opportunities offered by the Copernicus programme, such as EO*GI solutions and each EU farmer (also through farmer associations, agencies, etc) is stimulated to improve his/her “e-governance”.
							After specific analyses/controls at national and regional level, nowadays well supported by the Copernicus Programme, EU officers authorize the final funds transferring to each EU Member States and then to each single beneficiary." />
		<meta property="dc:tableOfContents" content="This training is addressed to non-experts in EO and modelling, but for students who may be using EO data for agricultural management in the future or at their current work. By participating in the webinar, students will understand how to acquire data using remote sensing methods and how such collected data can be used to improve knowledge concerning Vegetation Indeces."; />
		<meta property="dc:description" content="Learning outcomes: Understand the importance of the CAP in Europe; Identify which EO data/products can support the CAP and how, Understand how to interpret and integrate EO time series useful for agriculture; Understand how to derive agro-parcel layers by EO data, to be integrated with other relevant information; Recognize how to re-use EO data derived information for a sustainable agriculture and climate changes limitation actions; Become aware of the possibilities offered by the correct use of EO data through spatial and temporal resolutions" />
