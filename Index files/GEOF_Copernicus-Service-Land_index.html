				Copernicus is an EU programme aimed at developing European information services based on satellite Earth Observation and in situ (non space) data.
				Copernicus is implemented by the European Commission (EC) with the support from the European Space Agency (ESA) for the Space component and the European Environment Agency (EEA) for the in situ component.
				The objective of Copernicus is to monitor and forecast the state of the environment on land, sea and in the atmosphere, in order to support climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies, the efficient management of emergency situations and the improvement of the security of every citizen. Information provided by Copernicus improves people's safety, e.g. by providing information on natural disasters such as forest fires or floods, and thus help to prevent the loss of lives and property, and damages to the environment.
				Copernicus is a user driven programme and the information services provided are available to its Users, mostly public authorities, on a full, open and free-of-charge basis.
				The Copernicus Programme is served by dedicated satellites (the Copernicus Sentinel families) and a set of additional Contributing Missions (satellites run by various commercial and national agencies). Since the launch of Sentinel-1A in 2014, the European Union set in motion a process to place a constellation of almost 20 more satellites in orbit before 2030. This satellite data is complemented by and validated with in situ data. 
				Six Copernicus Services transform the full, free and open data into value-added information by processing and analyzing the data and transforming them into services and products such as informative maps and data sets: 
				•	The Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service
				•	The Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service
				•	The Copernicus Land Monitoring Service
				•	The Copernicus Climate Change Service
				•	The Copernicus Emergency Management Service
				•	The Copernicus Security Service
				Copernicus
				European Environment Agency (EEA)
				
				Copernicus is a European programme for monitoring the Earth. It combines satellite observation data with data from sensor networks on the Earth’s surface to build a comprehensive picture of our planet and its environment.
				Three components make up Copernicus: Space, Services and In Situ. The Services Component is made up of six areas: land, marine, atmosphere, climate change, emergency management and security. Within these services, the data collected are processed to give reliable and up-to-date information about the six thematic areas.
				EEA and Copernicus
				The European Environment Agency (EEA) has been entrusted with the coordination of the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service (CLMS) and the Copernicus In Situ Component, under a Delegation Agreement with the European Commission
				
				Copernicus Land Monitoring Service (CLMS)
				The Copernicus Land Monitoring Service has been jointly implemented by the European Environment Agency (EEA) and the Joint Research Centre (JRC) since 2011.
				The Copernicus Land Monitoring Service (CLMS) provides geographical information on land cover to a broad range of users in the field of environmental terrestrial applications. This includes information on land cover characteristics and changes, land use, vegetation state, water cycle and Earth surface energy variables.
				CLMS products are divided into five categories:
				•	Systematic biophysical monitoring
				•	Land cover and land use mapping
				•	Thematic hotspot mapping
				•	Reference data
				•	Ground motion service
				These categories enable applications to be developed in a wide range of areas, including:
				•	Spatial and urban planning
				•	Forest management
				•	Water management
				•	Agriculture and food security
				•	Nature conservation and restoration
				•	Ecosystem accounting
				•	Climate change mitigation
				Copernicus products and services are continually evolving. They are defined, created and developed in consultation with the Copernicus User Forum, which liaises with stakeholder communities. The European Commission and EU Member States, as well as participating countries in the Copernicus Committee set priorities for products. The European Environment Agency (EEA) also works in cooperation with other Copernicus Services, such as Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring and Copernicus Emergency Management, to create new products.

					<li>Aims to provide <strong>specific and more detailed information </strong>that is complementary to the information obtained through the Pan-European component.</li>
					<li><strong>F</strong><strong>ocus</strong><strong> on different hotspots</strong> (areas that are prone to specific environmental challenges and problems).</li>
					<li>It will be <strong>based on very high resolution imagery </strong>(2,5 x 2,5 m pixels) in combination with other available datasets (high and medium resolution images) over the pan-European area.</li>

					<ul>
					<li><strong>Urban Atlas</strong>
					<ul>

					<li><strong>Natura 2000</strong>
					<ul>
					<li>the aim is to map LC/LU in a selection of grassland rich sites and to assess whether those selected sites are being effectively preserved as well as, if a decline of certain grassland habitat types is being halted.</li>

					<h2>Imagery and Reference Data Component</h2>

					<li>Copernicus land services need <strong>both satellite images and </strong><strong><em>in-situ</em></strong> data in order to create reliable products and services.</li>
					<li>Satellite imagery <strong>forms the input </strong>for the creation of many information products and services.</li>
					<li>Many in-situ data are managed and made accessible at national level.</li>
					<li>Copernicus services and particularly CLMS relies on pan-European <em>in-situ</em> datasets created and/or coordinated at European level.</li>
					<li>This <em>in-situ</em> data used for <strong>verification and validation </strong>of several information services in the CLMS portfolio.</li>
