		<meta property="dc:abstract" content="This course introduces preprocessing operations, sometimes referred to as image restoration and correction, used to correct radiometric and geometric data distortions specific to sensors used in EO. Radiometric corrections are required due to variations in scene lighting and viewing geometry, atmospheric conditions and noise, and sensor response. Each will vary depending on the particular sensor and platform used for data collection and the conditions during data collection. It may also be desirable to convert and/or calibrate the data into known (absolute) units of radiation or reflection to facilitate data comparison. Geometric corrections are intended to compensate for geometric distortions so that the geometric representation of the imagery will be as close as possible to the real world. Many of these variations are systematic, or predictable in nature and can be accounted for by accurate modeling of the sensor and platform motion and the geometric relationship of the platform with the Earth. Other unsystematic, or random, errors cannot be modeled and corrected in this way. Therefore, geometric registration of the imagery to a known ground coordinate system must be performed." />

				Earth Observation for decision-making
				Targeted and efficient environmental policies need a strong evidence base that accounts for the geographical distribution of environmental phenomena and economic activity. The existing evidence base of environmental policies has traditionally suffered from data gaps or incoherent time series. Earth observation from satellites, aircrafts and drones, in-situ measurements or ground-based monitoring stations, can provide a unique and timely source of data that is commensurable across countries, regions and cities. It can help harmonise international reporting on natural resources, ecosystems and environmental sinks. It can be combined with other geo-referenced socio-demographic, economic and public administration data to make indicators and analysis more relevant and targeted. Earth observation is not new, but it is only recently that investments in satellite capabilities, open and free access to data and tools, and advances in algorithms and data processing have started to enable the widespread use of this information at scale, and beyond the specialised scientific community. These developments offer opportunities for improving the range and robustness of environmental data and indicators.

					<h1>What is Preprocessing?</h1> 
					<ul>
					<li>In the context of digital analysis of remotely sensed data, <em>preprocessing </em>refers to those operations that are preliminary to the primary analysis (processing).</li>
					<li>Typical preprocessing operations could include:</li>
					<li>(1) radiometric preprocessing to adjust digital values for effects of a hazy atmosphere and/or</li>
					<li>(2) geometric preprocessing to bring an image into registration with a map or another image.</li>
					<li>Once corrections have been made, the data can then be subjected to the primary analyses.</li>
					<li>Preprocessing forms a preparatory phase that improves image quality.</li>
					</ul>
					</section>
				
					<section > 
					<br>
					<h2>Preprocessing facts</h2> 
					<ul>
					<li><strong>It should be emphasized that</strong><strong>:</strong> there can be no definitive list of &ldquo;standard&rdquo; preprocessing steps.</li>
					<li>The quality of image data varies greatly, so <strong>some data may not require </strong><strong>the </strong><strong>some</strong> <strong>type</strong> <strong>of</strong> <strong>preprocessing </strong>that would be necessary in other instances.</li>
					<li>Also, <strong>preprocessing alters image da</strong><strong>t</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>!!!</strong></li>
					<li>Although we may assume that such changes are beneficial, <strong>the analyst should remember that preprocessing may create artifacts</strong> that are not immediately obvious.</li>
					<li>The analyst should tailor preprocessing to the data at hand and the needs of specific projects
					<ul>
					<li>Using only those preprocessing operations essential to obtain a specific result.</li>
					</ul>

					<h2>Preprocessing Operations</h2> 
					<ul>
					<li>Preprocessing operations, sometimes referred to as <strong>image restoration</strong> and <strong>rectification</strong>, are intended to correct for sensor- and platform-specific radiometric and geometric distortions of data.</li>
					<li>Radiometric corrections may be necessary due to variations in scene illumination and viewing geometry, atmospheric conditions, and sensor noise and response.</li>
					<li>Each of these will vary depending on the specific sensor and platform used to acquire the data and the conditions during data acquisition.</li>
					<li>Also, it may be desirable to convert and/or calibrate the data to known (absolute) radiation or reflectance units to facilitate comparison between data.</li>

					<h2>Geometric and Radiometric errors</h2> 
					<ul>
					<li>When image data is recorded by sensors on satellites and aircraft <strong>it can contain</strong> <strong>errors in geometry</strong>, <strong>and</strong> in the measured <strong>brightness values </strong>of the pixels.</li>
					<li>The second are referred to as <strong>radiometric errors </strong>and can result from
					<ul>
					<li>the instrumentation used to record the data the wavelength dependence of solar radiation and</li>
					<li>the effect of the atmosphere.</li>
					</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Geometric errors can also arise in several ways.
					<ul>
					<li>the relative motions of the platform.</li>
					<li>non-idealities in the sensors themselves,</li>
					<li>the curvature of the earth and uncontrolled variations in the position,</li>
					<li>velocity and attitude of the remote sensing platform can all lead to geometric errors of varying degrees of severity.</li>
					</ul>
					</li>
					</ul>				
					</section>

					<section>
					<br>
					<h2>Geometric and Radiometric errors (2)</h2> 
					<ul>
					<li>It is usually important to correct errors in image brightness and geometry.</li>
					<li>That is certainly the case if the image is to be as representative as possible of the scene being recorded.</li>
					<li>It is also important if the image is to be interpreted manually.</li>
					<li>If an image is to be analysed automaticali (by machine), using the specific algorithms, it is not always necessary to correct the data beforehand;
					<ul>
					<li>that depends on the analytical technique being used.</li>
					</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Some institutions (experts) of thought recommend against correction when analysis is based on pattern recognition methods.</li>
					</ul>				
					</section>				

					<section>
					<br>
					<h2>Instrumentation Radiometric Errors</h2> 
					<ul>
					<li>Mechanisms that affect the measured brightness values of the pixels in an image can lead to <strong>two broad types of radiometric distortion</strong>.</li>
					<li><strong>First</strong>, the distribution of brightness over an image in a given band can be different from that in the ground scene.</li>
					<li><strong>Secondly</strong>, the relative brightness of a single pixel from band to band can be distorted compared with the spectral reflectance character of the corresponding region on the ground.</li>
					<li>Both types can result from the presence of the atmosphere as a transmission medium through which radiation must travel from its source to the sensors, and can also be the result of instrumentation effects.</li>
					</ul>				
					</section>						
				
					<section>
					<br>
					<h2>Sources of Radiometric Distortion (1)</h2> 
					<ul>
					<li>An ideal detected radiation should be linear.</li>
					<li>Real detectors will have some degree of non-linearity.</li>
					<li>There will also be a small signal out, even when there is no radiation in.</li>
					<li>Historically that is known as <strong>dark current </strong>and is the result of residual electronic noise present in the detector at any temperature other than absolute zero.</li>
					<li>In remote sensing it is usually called a <strong>detector offset</strong>.</li>
					<li>The slope of the detector curve is called its <strong>gain</strong>, or sometimes <strong>transfer </strong><strong>gain</strong>.</li>
					</ul>			
					</section>					
					
					<section>
					<br>
					<h2>Sources of Radiometric Distortion (2)</h2> 
					<ul>
					<li>An ideal radiation detector has a transfer characteristic such as that shown in Figure a.</li>

					<h2>Sources of Radiometric Distortion (4)</h2> 
					<ul>
					<li>Most imaging devices used in remote sensing are constructed from sets of detectors.</li>
					<li>In the case of the Landsat ETM+ there are 16 per band.</li>
					<li>Each will have slightly different transfer characteristics, such as those depicted in previous Figure b.</li>
					<li>Those imbalances will lead to striping in the across swath direction.</li>
					<li>For push broom scanners there are as many as 12,000 detectors across the swath in the panchromatic mode of operation.</li>
					<li>For monolithic sensor arrays that is rarely a problem, compared with the line striping that can occur with mechanical across track scanners that employ discrete detectors.</li>

					<h2>Sources of Radiometric Distortion (7)</h2>

					<h2>Correcting Instrumentation Errors</h2> 
					<ul>
					<li>Errors in relative brightness can be rectified to a great extent in the following way.</li>
					<li>First, it is assumed that the detectors used for data acquisition in each band produce signals statistically similar to each other.</li>
					<li>If the means and standard deviations are computed for the signals recorded by each of the detectors over the full scene then they should almost be the same.</li>
					<li>This requires the assumption that statistical detail within a band doesn&rsquo;t change significantly over a distance equivalent to that of one scan covered by the set of the detectors.</li>
					<li>For most scenes this is usually a reasonable assumption in terms of the means and standard deviations of pixel brightness.</li>
					</ul>	
					</section>	

					<section>
					<br>
					<h2>Correcting Instrumentation Errors: Striping (1)</h2> 
					<ul>
					<li>Optical/mechanical scanners are subject to a kind of radiometric error known as <em>striping</em>, or <em>dropped scan lines</em>, which appear as a horizontal banding caused by small differences in the sensitivities of detectors within the sensor.</li>
					<li>Within a given band, such differences appear on images as banding where individual scan lines exhibit unusually brighter or darker brightness values that contrast with the background brightnesses of the &ldquo;normal&rdquo; detectors.</li>
					<li>Sensor mismatches of this type can be corrected by calculating pixel mean brightness and standard deviation using lines of image data known to come from a single detector.</li>
					</ul>
					</section>	

					<section>
					<br>
					<h2>Correcting Instrumentation Errors: Striping (2)</h2> 
					<ul>
					<li>Within the Landsat MSS this error is known as <em>sixth-line striping </em>due to the design of the instrument.</li>
					<li>Because MSS detectors are positioned in arrays of six, an anomalous detector response appears as linear banding at intervals of six lines.</li>
					<li>In the case of Landsat MSS that will require the data on every sixth line to be used.</li>
					<li>In a like manner five other measurements of mean brightness and standard deviation are computed for the other five MSS detectors.</li>
					</ul>

					<h2>Correcting Instrumentation Errors: Striping (3)</h2> 
					<ul>
					<li>Correction of radiometric mismatches among the detectors can then be carried out by adopting one sensor as a standard and adjusting the brightnesses of all pixels recorded by each other detector.</li>
					<li>This operation is called <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>destriping</strong></span>.</li>
					<li><em>Destriping</em> refers to the application of algorithms to adjust incorrect brightness values to values thought to be near the correct values.</li>

					<li>A second strategy is to replace bad pixels with new values based on the mean and standard deviation of the band in question or on statistics developed for each detector.</li>

					<h1>Radiometric Preprocessing (1)</h1> 
					<ul>
					<li>Radiometric preprocessing influences the brightness values of an image to correct for sensor malfunctions or to adjust the values to compensate for atmospheric degradation.</li>
					<li>Any sensor that observes the Earth&rsquo;s surface using visible or near visible radiation will record a mixture of two kinds of brightnesses:
					<ul>
					<li>the brightness derived from the Earth&rsquo;s surface &mdash; that is, the brightnesses that are of interest for remote sensing.</li>
					<li>the sensor also observes the brightness of the atmosphere itself &mdash;the effects of atmospheric scattering.</li>
					</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Thus an observed digital brightness value (e.g., &ldquo;56&rdquo;) might be in part the result of surface reflectance (e.g., &ldquo;45&rdquo;) and in part the result of atmospheric scattering (e.g., &ldquo;11&rdquo;).</li>
					</ul>
					</section>
								
					<section>
					<br>
					<h1>Radiometric Preprocessing (2)</h1> 
					<ul>
					<li>Of course we cannot immediately distinguish between the two brightnesses.</li>
					<li>So, one objective of atmospheric correction is to identify and separate these two components.</li>
					<li>Ideally, atmospheric correction should find a separate correction for each pixel in the scene.</li>
					<li>In practice, we may apply the same correction to an entire band or apply a single factor to a local region within the image.</li>

					<h2>Preprocessing operations: Radiative Transfer Code (1)</h2> 
					<ul>
					<li>Preprocessing operations to correct for atmospheric degradation fall into three rather broad categories.</li>
					<li>First - procedures known as <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>radiative transfer code</strong> (<strong>RTC</strong>)</span> computer models.</li>
					<li>Application of such models permits <span style="color: #ff0000;">observed brightnesses to be adjusted to approximate true values</span> that might be observed under a clear atmosphere
					<ul>
					<li>thereby improving image quality and accuracies of analyses.</li>
					</ul>
					</li>
					<li>RTC models the physical process of scattering at the level of individual particles and molecules,
					<ul>
					<li><strong>this approach has</strong> <strong>important advantages with respect to </strong>rigor, accuracy, and applicability to a wide variety of circumstances.</li>
					</ul>
					</li>
					</ul>
					</section>

					<section>
					<br>
					<h2>Preprocessing operations: Radiative Transfer Code (2)</h2> 
					<ul>
					<li>RTC also have significant disadvantages.</li>
					<li>Often <strong>they are complex</strong>, usually <span style="color: #ff0000;">requiring detailed in situ data acquired</span> simultaneously with the image and/or satellite data describing the atmospheric column at the time and place of acquisition of an image.</li>
					<li>Such data may be difficult to obtain in the necessary detail and may apply only to a few points within a scene.</li>
					<li>Although meteorological satellites collect atmospheric data that can contribute to atmospheric corrections of imagery.</li>
					</ul>
					</section>					

					<section>
					<br>
					<h2>Preprocessing operations: Image-based Atmospheric Correction (1)</h2> 
					<ul>
					<li>A second approach based on examination of spectra of objects of known or assumed brightness recorded by multispectral imagery.</li>
					<li>From basic principles of atmospheric scattering - scattering is related to wavelength, sizes of atmospheric particles, and their abundance.</li>
					<li>If a known target is observed using a set of multispectral measurements, the relationships between values in the separate bands can help assess atmospheric effects.</li>
					<li>This approach is often known as &ldquo;<strong>image-based atmospheric correction</strong>&rdquo;.</li>

					<li>Ideally, the target consists of a natural or man-made feature that can be observed with airborne or ground-based instruments at the time of image.</li>
					<li>However, in practice we seldom have such measurements, and therefore we must look for features of known brightness that commonly, or fortuitously, appear within an image.</li>
					<li>In its simplest form, this strategy can be implemented by identifying a very dark object or feature within the scene.</li>

					<li>Both procedures assume that within a specified image region, variations in image brightness are due to topographic irregularities and reflectivity is constant.</li>
					<li>Therefore, variations in brightness are caused by small-scale topographic shadowing, and the dark regions reveal the contributions of scattering to each band.</li>

					<h1>Estimation of Top of Atmosphere Reflectance</h1> 
					<ul>
					<li>Accurate measurement of brightness, whether measured as radiances or as DNs, is not optimal because such values are subject to modification by differences in

					<li>Sun angle,</li>
					<li>atmospheric effects,</li>
					<li>angle of observation, and</li>
					<li>other effects that introduce brightness errors unrelated to the characteristics we wish to observe.</li>

					</li>
					<li>It is much more useful to observe the <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>proportion</em></strong> </span>of radiation reflected from varied objects relative to the amount of the same wavelengths incident upon the object.</li>
					<li>This proportion, known as <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>reflectance</em></strong></span>, is useful for defining the distinctive spectral characteristics of objects.</li>

					<li>As a ratio, reflectance is a dimensionless number (varying between 0 and 1), but it is commonly expressed as a percentage.</li>

					<li>Radiance is the amount of light the instrument detects from the object being observed.</li>
					<li>When looking through an atmosphere, some light scattered by the atmosphere will be seen by the instrument and included in the observed radiance of the target.</li>
					<li>An atmosphere will also absorb light, which will decrease the observed radiance.</li>
					<li>Reflectance is the ratio of the amount of light leaving a target to the amount of light striking the target.</li>

					<li>Precise estimation of reflectance would require detailed in situ measurement of wavelength, angles of illumination and observation, and atmospheric conditions at the time of observation.</li>
					<li>Because such measurements are impractical on a routine basis, we must approximate the necessary values.</li>
					<li>Usually, the analyst has a measurement of the brightness of a specific pixel at the lens of a sensor, sometimes known as <em>at-aperture,</em> <em>in-band </em>radiance, signifying that it represents radiance measured at the sensor for a specific spectral channel.</li>

					<h2>Estimation of Top of Atmosphere Reflectance (5)</h2>

					<li>To estimate the reflectance of the pixel, it is necessary to assess how much radiation was incident upon the object before it was reflected to the sensor.</li>
					<li>In the ideal, the analyst could measure this brightness at ground level just before it was redirected to the sensor.</li>
					<li>Although analysts sometimes collect this information in the field using specialized instruments known as spectroradiometers
					<ul>

					<h1>Identification of Image Features</h1> 
					<ul>
					<li>In the context of image processing, the terms <em>feature extraction </em>and <em>feature selection</em> have specialized meanings.</li>
					<li>&ldquo;Features&rdquo; are &ldquo;statistical&rdquo; characteristics of image data.</li>
					<li><em>Feature extraction </em>usually identifies specific bands or channels that are of greatest value for any analysis
					<ul>
					<li>whereas <em>feature selection </em>indicates selection of image information that is specifically tailored for a particular application.</li>
					</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Thus these processes could also be known as &ldquo;information extraction&rdquo;.</li>
					</ul>
					</section>
				
					<section>
					<br>
					<h2>Identification of Image Features (2)</h2> 
					<ul>
					<li>In theory, discarded data contain noise and errors present in original data.</li>
					<li>Thus feature extraction may increase accuracy.</li>
					<li>In addition, these processes reduce the number of spectral channels, or bands, that must be analyzed, thereby reducing computational demands.</li>
					<li>The analyst can work with fewer but more potent channels.</li>
					<li>The reduced data set may convey almost as much information as does the complete data set.</li>
					</ul>
					</section>					
						
					<section>
					<br>
					<h2>Identification of Image Features (3)</h2> 
					<ul>
					<li>Multispectral data, by their nature, consist of several channels of data.</li>
					<li>Although some images may have as few as 3, 4, or 7 channels, other image data may have many more, possibly 200 or more channels.</li>
					<li>With so much data, processing of even modest-sized images requires considerable time.</li>
					<li>In this context, feature selection assumes considerable practical significance, as image analysts wish to reduce the amount of data while retaining effectiveness and/or accuracy.</li>
					</ul>
					</section>						

					<section>
					<br>
					<h2>Identification of Image Features - Example</h2>
					<br><img width="700" height="200" img src="./resources/Preprocessing-of-EO-data/Slide-58.jpg" alt="sat1">
					<ul>
					<li>A variance &ndash; covariance matrix shows interrelationships between pairs of bands (TM have 7 bands).</li>
					<li>Some pairs show rather strong correlations &mdash; for example, bands 1 and 3 and 2 and 3 both show correlations above 0.9.</li>
					<li>High correlation between pairs of bands means that the values in the two channels are closely related.</li>
					<li>Thus, as values in channel 2 rise or fall, so do those in channel 3; one channel tends to duplicate information in the other.</li>
					<li>Feature selection attempts to identify, then remove, such duplication so that the dataset can include maximum information using the minimum number of channels.</li>
					</ul>
					</section>						
					
					<section>
					<br>
					<h2>Identification of Image Features - Example (2)</h2>
					<ul>
					<li>For data represented by previous Table, bands 3, 5, and 6 might include almost as much information as the entire set of seven channels, because band 3 is closely related to bands 1 and 2, band 5 is closely related to bands 4 and 7, and band 6 carries information largely unrelated to any others.</li>
					<li>Therefore, the discarded channels (1, 2, 4, and 7) each resemble one of the channels that have been retained.</li>
					<li>So a simple approach to feature selection discards unneeded bands, thereby reducing the number of channels.</li>
					<li>Although this kind of selection can be used as a sort of rudimentary feature extraction, typically feature selection is a more complex process based on statistical interrelationships between channels.</li>
