				Abstract
				In the context of remote sensing, validation refers to the process of assessing the uncertainty of higher level, satellite sensor derived products by analytical comparison to reference data, which is presumed to represent the true value of an attribute. Naturally, validation is an essential component of any earth observation program, since it enables the independent verification of the physical measurements obtained by a sensor as well as any derived products. After presenting some relevant definitions, this chapter draws on international and national validation campaigns to summarize some of the major components involved when using ground-reference data to validate biophysical products derived through Earth Observation (EO) data. These include site selection, site extent, and sampling design. The process of up-scaling, which enables the validation of coarse resolution products via the comparison of measurements made at various scales (i.e., ground-based, intermediate-airborne) is also reviewed. The chapter concludes with a brief section on alternative validation methods.
				Key Points
				• The Committee of Earth Observing Satellites has identified four stages of validation, each of which is progressively more comprehensive.
				• Satellite derived products can be validated directly using an independent data source that is representative of the target values or indirectly through product inter-comparison and/or by collecting measurements across various scales and upscaling.
				• Sites chosen for validation should meet certain criteria, including the following: be accessible to researchers; encompass existing facilities such as flux towers which collect measurements of biophysical variables over extended periods of time; have long-term commitment to scientific studies; represent significant areas of homogenous or uniformly mixed land cover.
				• The site extent of a validation site must be large enough to represent the pixel size of the sensor being validated.
				• The sampling design implemented for ground-based measurements is driven by two main factors: (a) the footprint of the field measurements and (b) up-scaling process used to integrate the field measurements and high resolution imagery
				• Field activities should be carried out within a week of satellite/airborne acquisition to prevent significant changes in vegetation. However, the rate at which the state of the vegetation evolves varies for different ecosystems and is also influenced by its successional state.
				• When devising a sampling design, many projects choose a sampling scheme based on elementary and secondary sampling units. Elementary sampling units (ESU) aim to capture the variability of the product being validated across the study site (this can be determined from a current land cover or floristic map, surface reflectance as characterized by recently acquired satellite imagery). Secondary sampling units (SSU) are distributed across the ESU and represent the specific locations where measurements are recorded. Different sampling designs can be implemented within SSU including fixed pattern, transect, randomized designs.
				• Up-scaling is generally achieved via the integration of field measurements and a high-resolution image, which results in the production of a high resolution map of the parameter measured in the field.				</aside>

						<li>A key component of any validation is to check the consistency (comparison) of remote sensing data with reference measurements</li>
						<li>Reference measurements are assumed to represent the truth (at least within their own uncertainties).</li>
						<li>The EO and reference data are (in an ideal case) both linked to a stated metrological reference through an unbroken chain of calibrations or comparisons.</li>
						<li>In practice, reference data can range from fully SI (Syst&egrave;me International) traceable to loosely agreed community standards.</li>
						<li>Ground measurements - fully characterized and traceable are often called Fiducial Reference Measurements (FRM).</li>

						<li>In practice, EO data are rarely fully traceable.</li>
						<li>Basic calibrations were performed under laboratory conditions can&rsquo;t repeat in Space.</li>

						<li>What exactly is meant by measurement uncertainty?</li>
						<li>The terms "error" and "uncertainty" are often used interchangeably in the scientific community.</li>
						<li>In metrology, measurement uncertainty is the expression of the statistical dispersion of the values attributed to a measured quantity.</li>
						<li>The measurement error - the difference between the measured value and the true value.</li>

						<li>The Guide to the expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM) [JCGM, 2008, 2009, 2011] prescribes how these component uncertainties are combined to give an overall uncertainty associated with measurements from each system, denoted in the current paper with ux and uy.</li>

						<li>(1) Do the data provide scientifically meaningful estimates of the investigated geophysical quantity?</li>
						<li>(2) Do these data sufficiently cover the potential parameter space?</li>
						<li>(3) Are the data expected to be accurate enough to be able to draw desired conclusions from the validation process?</li>

						<h2>The Validation Process - Quality Checking</h2> 
						<br>
						<ul>
						<li>Many data providers include information on data quality within their data sets.</li>
						<li>Data quality information can be provided as simple binary flags (good/poor data quality) or gradated flags representing a number of different quality levels.</li>
						<li>Alternatively, data may be provided with quantitative uncertainty measures.</li>
						<li>In some cases, additional checks may be required, such as:
						<ul>
						<li>checking the physical probability of a particular measurement,</li>
						<li>visually inspecting the data, or</li>
						<li>testing the time consistency.</li>
						</ul>

						<br>
						<h2>The Validation Process - Spatiotemporal Collocation</h2> 
						<br>
						<p>The following concerns are to be addressed:</p>
						<ol>
						<li>Collocated measurements should be close to each other relative to the spatiotemporal scale on which the variability of the geophysical field becomes comparable to the measurement uncertainties.</li>
						<li>If possible, differences in spatiotemporal resolution (horizontal, vertical, and temporal) should be minimized.</li>
						<li>The collocation criteria should take into account the need for sufficient collocated pairs for robust statistical analysis. This need is often at odds with the first concern, and a compromise must be made</li>
						</ol>
					</section>	

					<section > 
						<br>
						<h2>The Validation Process - Spatiotemporal Collocation 2</h2> 
						<br>
						<p>Broadly speaking, there are two categories of collocation methods</p>
						<ol>
						<li>Those that keep the data on their original grids and select the closest matches and</li>
						<li>Those that use interpolation and aggregation techniques (e.g., regridding, resampling, and kriging) to bring both data sets onto the same grid and temporal scale.</li>
						</ol>
					</section>	

					<section > 
						<br>
						<h2>The Validation Process – Homogenization -  Metric Calculation</h2> 
						<br>
						<ul>
						<li>In many cases, further homogenization between the two data sets is necessary before actual differences can be computed.</li>
						<li>Homogenization (transformation) of radiometric and spatial resolutions between data sets.</li>
						<li>Units and other representation conversions are often required, and these can introduce additional uncertainties.</li>
						<li>The choice of metrics used within the validation process depends on the application and data available.</li>
						</ul>
					</section>	

					<section > 
						<br>
						<h2>The Validation Process – Analysis and Interpretation</h2> 
						<br>
						<ul>
						<li>Once the final metrics have been obtained, it needs to be judged if the results are compliant with the requirements.</li>
						<li>Following the definition of validation (see Slide 1), this implies verification that the data set is suitable for a specific application.</li>
						<li>In many cases a single application does not exist.</li>
						<li>Requirements may be numerous and, thus, validation targets would need to be defined</li>
						<li>Which could then be checked for compliance on an individual basis.</li>

						<br>
						<ul>
						<li>For validation purposes, we are not primarily interested in the differences for each individual pair of observations, but the underlying probability density function (PDF) of 𝛿, f𝛿</li>
						<li>The uncertainty assessment requires detailed understanding of the individual contributions to the PDF, i.e.,
						<ol>
						<li>systematic effects due to individual measurement devices and retrieval procedures (h, k), including large-scale systematic effects due to instrument calibration or harmonization;</li>

						<h1>Advanced Validation Approaches and Strategies - Spectral Methods</h1> 
						<br>
						<ul>
						<li>Several studies in different communities have demonstrated approaches to apply spectral-based methods as validation techniques over a broad range of data sources and timescales.</li>
						</ul>
					</section>	
				
					<section class="scrollable">
						<br>
						<h2>Spectral Methods - Fourier-Based Approaches</h2> 
						<ul>
						<li>These approach finds expression in the standard Fourier transform, which resolves the frequencies underlying the signal of interest.</li>
						<li>A mathematical description of the mean-square error (MSE) as an index of accuracy in estimating the ground measurement (point gauges) using spaceborne measurements.</li>
						<li>Another approach detects characteristic features of erroneous SM estimates fromEO data in the frequency domain.
						<ul>
						<li>Results indicate that higher retrieval error standard deviations go along with higher vegetation/leaf area index, rainfall, and SM.</li>
						</ul>
						</li>
						</ul>
					</section>		

					<section class="scrollable">
						<br>
						<h2>Spectral Methods - Consistency Through Process Models</h2> 
						<ul>
						<li>Process models reflect our understanding of the relevant processes governing the system under observation and of their interaction.</li>
						<li>They can ensure properties such as conservation of mass, energy, or momentum.</li>
						<li>Such models can be used in the validation context in various ways.</li>
						</ul>
					</section>	

					<section class="scrollable">
						<br>
						<h2>Spectral Methods - Indirect Validation</h2> 
						<ul>
						<li>Indirect validation approaches map the observational data product to a secondary variable, which is then compared against reference data of the same geophysical variable.</li>
						<li>The performance of the secondary variable (in comparison with reference data) provides information on the quality of the observational data product</li>
						</ul>
					</section>	

					<section class="scrollable">
						<br>
						<h2>Spectral Methods - The Role of Data Assimilation for EO Validation</h2> 
						<ul>
						<li>Satellite data plays a key role in current data assimilation systems within numerical weather prediction models.</li>
						<li>The direct assimilation of passive microwave and infrared radiance data has had a particularly large beneficial impact on analysis and forecast quality [Joo et al., 2013].</li>
						<li>Key challenges include the lack of traceable radiometric measurements from on-orbit satellite radiometers and a lack of traceable ground truth observations against which to validate the satellite observations.</li>
						</ul>
					</section>	

					<section class="scrollable">
						<br>
						<h2>Spectral Methods - Assessing Uncertainty From Scale Mismatch</h2> 
						<ul>
						<li>In the atmospheric range, when measuring temperature, water vapor, or trace gas concentration, reference measurements are usually sparsely distributed in space and time with respect to measurements based on a wider resolution universe.</li>
						<li>This makes it difficult to find strict collocation criteria, magnification methods, or even an estimate of the collocation uncertainty involved in the comparison.</li>
						</ul>
					</section>					

					<section class="scrollable">
						<br>
						<h2>Spectral Methods - Assessing Uncertainty From Scale Mismatch 2</h2> 
						<p>Several strategies have been devised to overcome this issue:</p>
						<ol>
						<li>Taking more than one reference point measurement.</li>
						<li>Estimate the collocation errors (and resulting uncertainties) when comparing single-reference measurements with satellite data using.</li>
						<li>When only a single-reference measurement is made,&nbsp;for example, a radiosonde measurement compared to a satellite-based one, the collocation uncertainties become nonnegligible.</li>

						<h1>The Ultimate Goal of a Validation</h1> 
						<br>
						<ul>
						<li>To assess whether a data set is compliant with predefined benchmarks (requirements) that quantify whether a data set is suitable for a particular purpose.</li>
						<li>It is therefore essential that the metric itself is not ambiguous and allows to fully capture the data quality.</li>
						</ul>
					</section>	

					<section class="scrollable">
						<br>
						<h2>The Ultimate Goal of a Validation</h2> 
						<br>
						<p>Prerequisites apply for a proper definition of requirements to be used as such validation targets or benchmarks</p>
						<ol>
						<li>A clear specification of the spatial and temporal domains for each metric is essential.</li>
						<li>The mathematical details of the metric calculations have to be provided.</li>
						<li>It needs to be specified under which conditions a data set would be considered to fulfill the specified requirements.</li>
						<li>Clear separation between systematic and random error components is required.</li>
						</ol>
					</section>

					<section class="scrollable">
						<br>
						<h2>Recommendations for Validation Frameworks</h2> 
						<ul>
						<li>Refine user requirements.
						<ul>
						<li>Current definitions of user requirements are very often based on scalar metrics.</li>
						<li>The motivation for these scalar metrics needs to be much more traceable.</li>
						</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Beyondscalar metrics
						<ul>
						<li>Advanced validation methods should gain widespread use.</li>
						<li>These require a thorough understanding of the error characteristics of both the satellite and the reference data.</li>
						</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Collection of reference data.
						<ul>
						<li>Traceable approaches for the collection of reference data for EO validation are needed.</li>
						<li>The standards developed by the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites working group on calibration and validation define good standards already, but they are not necessarily available for all Essential Climate Variables</li>
						</ul>
						</li>
						</ul>
					</section>					

					<section class="scrollable">
						<br>
						<h2>Recommendations for Validation Frameworks 2</h2> 
						<ul>
						<li>Traceable data production.
						<ul>
						<li>Traceable data production chains are required that allow to trace back the method used for the production including full traceability of the satellite and ancillary data used, including their uncertainties.</li>
						</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Sustained fiducial references.
						<ul>
						<li>The sustained availability of fiducial reference data is not ensured for any of the communitiesworking withEOdata.</li>
						<li>Validation with fiducial references covering the spectrum of the natural variability of a geophysical variable is considered essential for all validation approaches.</li>
						</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Validation tools.
						<ul>
						<li>Traceable and open source-based tools for the validation of EO data currently do not exist.</li>
